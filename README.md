# MachineLearning


## Motivation 
This repo is more of a dump of code that I've written and figured others might be able to benefit from it.
The code is mostly just for educational purposes and to explore machine learning. If you wish to use these
constructs in production, you'll want to make some modifications to the code for performance and finish implementation 
on the various examples to be used for more than learning.  

### Sub Projects 
- [Neural Networks](./MachineLearning/src/main/scala/com/USALynch/machineLearning/neuralNetwork/README.md)

## Maintenance  
I don't intend on constantly maintaining this code. This is more of a base framework to start from. 
If you wish to contribute, please fork the repo and open a pull request/merge request. 


## Dependencies 
They are listed in `Dependencies.scala`. There's probably a lot of bloat from when I abstracted this from another repo.
